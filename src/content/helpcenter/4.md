## Managing Billing and Subscriptions

### Viewing Your Plan

To check your current subscription:

1. Go to **Settings > Billing**.
2. View your active plan, user count, and billing cycle.
3. See your usage limits for contacts, deals, and storage.

You’ll also see your **next renewal date** and a summary of charges.

### Changing Your Plan

To switch plans:

1. Click **Change Plan** in the Billing section.
2. Choose a different plan (e.g., Starter, Growth, Enterprise).
3. Select monthly or annual billing.
4. Confirm the change — your billing will be updated immediately.

Upgrades take effect right away; downgrades apply at the next renewal.

### Updating Payment Information

To update your card or payment method:

1. Go to **Settings > Billing > Payment Methods**.
2. Click **Update Payment Method**.
3. Enter your new card details and save.

Ælen CRM will use this method for future billing cycles
