## Setting Up Sales Pipelines

### What is a Sales Pipeline?

A sales pipeline helps you track deals as they move through the sales process. Each stage represents a key milestone, like _Qualified_, _Proposal Sent_, or _Closed Won_.

Pipelines give your team visibility into progress, bottlenecks, and opportunities.

### Creating a Pipeline

To create a new pipeline:

1. Go to **Settings > Pipelines**.
2. Click **New Pipeline**.
3. Give it a name (e.g., “Enterprise Sales” or “Inbound Deals”).
4. Define the stages that reflect your sales process.
5. Save and start adding deals to the new pipeline.

You can create multiple pipelines to organize sales efforts by team or workflow.

### Customizing Stages

You can modify pipeline stages to fit your needs:

- Rename existing stages by clicking on them.
- Drag and drop stages to reorder them.
- Add new stages or delete unused ones.
- Assign probabilities to each stage for forecasting.

Changes are saved instantly and apply to all users who share the pipeline.

### Managing Deals in Pipelines

To work with deals inside a pipeline:

- Go to the **Pipelines** tab in the sidebar.
- Click on any pipeline to view active deals.
- Drag deals between stages to update their status.
- Click into a deal to add notes, tasks, or assign team members.

Use filters to view deals by owner, close date, or custom fields.

### Best Practices

- Keep stage names action-oriented (e.g., _Contacted_, _Negotiating_).
- Review and update stages regularly as your process evolves.
- Use custom fields to track relevant deal info like contract value or source.

Ælen CRM’s pipeline tools help you stay organized and close more deals with confidence.
