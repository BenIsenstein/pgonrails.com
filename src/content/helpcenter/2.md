## Importing Data into Ælen CRM

### Preparing Your Data

Before importing, make sure your file is ready:

1. Save your data as a **CSV file**.
2. Include column headers that match CRM fields (e.g., Name, Email, Company, Stage).
3. Remove duplicates or incomplete records for best results.

You can find a downloadable template on the **Import** page.

### Importing Contacts, Companies, or Deals

To import data:

1. Go to **Settings > Import**.
2. Choose the data type (Contacts, Companies, Deals).
3. Upload your CSV file.
4. Map the columns to CRM fields.
5. Review and confirm the import.

You’ll see a summary of imported records and any rows that were skipped.

### Using Integrations to Migrate Data

If you're switching from another CRM:

- Go to **Settings > Integrations**.
- Select the platform (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.).
- Authenticate and follow the prompts to sync your data.

You can choose which data to import, and Ælen CRM will handle the mapping automatically.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Headers don’t match**: Make sure your CSV columns use supported field names.
- **Import failed**: Check for formatting errors, like missing emails or special characters.
- **Duplicates**: Use the deduplication tool post-import to clean your records.

### Undoing an Import

Accidentally imported the wrong file?

1. Go to **Settings > Import History**.
2. Find the recent import.
3. Click **Undo Import** to bulk-delete the imported records.

Note: You can only undo imports within 7 days of the original upload.
